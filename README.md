# Music Visualiser Project

Name 1:Eadaoin o Snodaigh
<br>Name 2:Fionan O Ceallaigh 
<br>Name 3:Alannah Walsh

Student Number 1: C22398106
<br>Student Number 2: C22337521
<br>Student Number 3: C22339066


## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
For this assignment, we were tasked as a group to make a music visualizer using Processing in Java. Each of us was assigned a specific case to add our visuals to the program. Each member took on the task and made creative additions to the program. Using github we  there are 7 cases in total, 2 made by alannah, 2 made by fionan and 3 made by eadaoin. across each of our cases we explored a various amount of functions. Fionan explored 3D models and matrixes, Alannah employed mouse input for one of her cases, and Eadaoin explored her creativity by combining two of her cases to making a unique 3rd case.

<p>The aspect I'm most proud of in my part of the assignment was my ability to adapt. I faced several instances where my code threw errors, and I wasn't sure why. These challenges were frustrating, but they became learning opportunities for me. Instead of giving up, I adapted. I researched, i watched videos and i ran my code again and again to try and improve it. One specific example comes to mind, before my finished product, in my case 4, i.e the cube case, i used to also have a wall class. the wall class was a long piece of code that i worked really hard on to get working, it reacted with the music and looked great along my cube class. But unfortunately, when putting it in the cases, the wall code stopped working, i tried for hours to try and fix it to no avail. i was frustrated and disappointed, 'why cant i get it' i thought. so i had to go back to the drawing board. i adapted and made the decision t remove the wall code and instead add two lines diagonally across the screen(as seen in the final program). Even though it was frustrating to remove the wall code, it was my ability to adapt and emply a new creative solution that i am really proud of, and will take forward with me. </p>

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
