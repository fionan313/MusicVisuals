## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
For this assignment, we were tasked as a group to make a music visualizer using Processing in Java. Each of us was assigned a specific case to add our visuals to the program. Each member took on the task and made creative additions to the program. Using github we  there are 7 cases in total, 2 made by alannah, 2 made by fionan and 3 made by eadaoin. across each of our cases we explored a various amount of functions. Fionan explored 3D models and matrixes, Alannah employed mouse input for one of her cases, and Eadaoin explored her creativity by combining two of her cases to making a unique 3rd case.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
